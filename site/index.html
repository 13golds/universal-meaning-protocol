<h1>Universal Meaning Protocol</h1>

<p>
Universal Meaning Protocol (UMP) is an open protocol for describing meaning as
states and transitions across different scales of reality.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Why UMP</h2>
<p>
Human languages are optimized for communication between humans.
UMP is designed for structured representation of meaning,
independent of culture, biology and spoken language.

<h2>Core entities</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>State</b> – observable configuration of a system</li>
<li><b>Observer</b> – reference point of interpretation</li>
<li><b>Scale</b> – level of description</li>
<li><b>Transition</b> – change between states</li>
<li><b>Interaction</b> – coupling of systems</li>
<li><b>Uncertainty</b> – limits of knowledge</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h2>Symbolic layer</h2>
<p>
Symbols are visual projections of structured meaning.
They do not replace the formal model.

<section>
<h2>Open evolution</h2>
<p>
The protocol is designed to evolve through open versioning.
All changes are recorded and discussed openly on GitHub.
