# Universal Meaning Protocol (UMP)

Universal Meaning Protocol is an open, evolving protocol for describing states, transitions and interactions
across different scales of reality — from human perception to cosmological processes.

UMP is not a spoken language.
It is a formal system for representing meaning as observable states and transformations.

The project focuses on:

- state-based representation
- observer-dependent meaning
- scale-aware models
- explicit transitions
- symbolic and visual encoding
- open evolution through versioning

This repository contains:

- core protocol specifications
- symbolic primitives
- examples of encoded observations
- tools for validation and visualization
- a public one-page site explaining the protocol

## Core concepts

- State — a measurable configuration of a system
- Observer — a reference point of interpretation
- Scale — the level at which a system is described
- Transition — change between states
- Interaction — coupling between systems
- Uncertainty — limits of knowledge and observation
